## Empowering the Community with PRTCLE Predictions on Twitch

SHE introduces PRTCLE Predictions, an engaging feature that brings web3 tokens into the world of Twitch predictions while empowering viewers to actively participate and drive the adoption of web3 within the community.

### How PRTCLE Predictions Work

PRTCLE Predictions utilize a Chrome extension to seamlessly integrate web3 tokens into existing Twitch predictions. This allows users to stake $PRTCLE or other chosen tokens, based on the outcome of their favorite streamers' challenges and milestones.

#### Believers vs. Doubters

To participate in PRTCLE Predictions, viewers can choose between two sides: "Believers" and "Doubters." Believers are those who have faith in the streamer's success, while Doubters are more skeptical. Believers can only stake $PRTCLE, while Doubters can stake a given subset of chosen tokens, such as USDC.

#### Decentralized Adoption and Upgrading Predictions

By enabling viewers to handle the web3 side of predictions, PRTCLE Predictions decentralize the adoption of web3 within the streaming community. This encourages an interconnected, vibrant community that is actively engaged in their favorite streamers' journeys and achievements.

The Chrome extension allows viewers to upgrade a web2 prediction made on Twitch to a SHE web3 prediction effortlessly. This user-friendly approach ensures that participating in PRTCLE Predictions is accessible and enjoyable for everyone.

### The Thrill of PRTCLE Predictions

PRTCLE Predictions offer a fun, captivating, and rewarding way to participate in your favorite streamers' journeys. By staking tokens and predicting the outcome of challenges and milestones, viewers can feel even more connected to the streamers they love and be part of the excitement that comes with every achievement.

With PRTCLE Predictions on Twitch, SHE aims to create a vibrant and interconnected community that thrives on the thrill of shared success and the exhilaration of watching streamers reach new heights.
