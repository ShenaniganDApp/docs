## ** What is Shenanigan? ** 🤸‍♀️
Shenanigan is an open source platform created for athletes and by athletes. We are creating a world where athletes can receive direct rewards for challenging themselves and pushing their own limits. Shenanigan wants to give athletes a platform to grow and earn at the same time. SHE achieves this by creating challenges specific to an athletes sport. Complete or fail athletes can earn rewards by trying to complete these challenges. *i.e. Complete a kickflip, or run 1500m”. This motivates the athlete to never give up while giving historical data of the athlete's growth. These accolades are tokenized and given to the athletes as a rare digital collectible. Athletes will be able to build a community that values their efforts and love for their sport. Members of these communities will be able to make donations to athletes, helping fuel their dreams. SHE is here to help you!

## ** Why does SHE do it? **!🏆

** Athlete ** = from the Greek origin “One who competes with effort for a prize.”

Now that you know the definition of an athlete, internalize it, and ask yourself, why do many athletes not have the opportunity to get that award? Why do so many athletes go unrewarded for their talent and dedication to their sport? Are the opportunities not the same for everyone? Are only some of them talented enough? Is it for some the effort is not proportional to their prize? Shenanigan encourages going further and never giving up. It gives athletes the chance to pursue their dreams and claim their prize! Shenanigan provides each athlete with the web3 instruments necessary to achieve this, it's your time! It's your career! It’s your life go get it!

## ** How do you do it? ** !📱

Our athletes download the Shenanigan mobile app and register for an athlete account. Once registered as an athlete the user will interact with the simple to use interface, quickly fill in the relevant information to start with a challenge. Below is a quick example of the challenge questionnaire.

Example:

> __**What sport do you play?**__
>    
>
> Athletics
>
> __**What specific category of sport?**__
>    
>
> Medium distance running - 1500m
> 
> __**Add a title for your challenge**__
>     
> 
> Run 1500m in less than 5 minutes
> 
> 
> **__Describe the challenge you are about to attempt**__
>     
> 
> I want to run 1500m in less than 5 minutes

After completing this information that will be the initial date of the athletes challenge, SHE mints the rare digital collectible card known as a “Challenge card”, along with its respective FAN Tokens and FAN CLUB. As the athlete attempts to complete these challenges they must livestream proof to the Shenanigan app where all the app users can vote on whether or not the athlete completed the challenge.

## * How do they benefit? *💰

Shenanigan generates a community where fans can directly donate to the success of their favorite athletes while watching their progress!. By completing challenges athletes are able to claim donations that their fan club members have provided them.

Shenanigan also creates a market of challenges and predictions to gamify live broadcasts where challengers (athletes) can be incentivized in various ways:

Each time a prediction is made, a small percentage of the total value is placed in escrow. Once an athlete is successful with their challenge, the value is released from the deposit along with an additional reward from the community.

Comparable to baseball cards, NRG cards will track unique stats and attributes that belong to the athlete. These stats will help you win more fans because users will base their purchases on them. As you grow and complete more challenges, we'll update your NRG card to reflect those stats. Followers become more than just followers, they feel like part of the game, specifically the athlete's game, as the owners of an athlete card will want to see constant improvement.

Donations, live challenges and card exchanges make up the total reward the athlete can earn by simply challenging themselves in the sport they love the most!

## *To achieve this; SHE has arrived *💖
Arisen from the ether, motivated by the oppressed and forgotten, SHE was born out of the love that athletes feel for their sport. SHE has been formed to bring a new world to athletes. SHE heard their cries for better opportunities, SHE responds to blood, sweat and tears. Her reason for being here is to reward those who think they have been forgotten. SHE sees everything and remembers each athlete's attempt to improve.

SHE controls with its great power the inner workings of the Shenanigan world. SHE is there to empower athletes and reward them for their success. It is SHE that provides us with a window into the realm of athletes, harnessing the threads of reality to transfer data through the world of Shenanigan.
