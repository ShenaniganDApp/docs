## NRG PACKS
$NRG Packs are an ERC 998 Standard collectable that represent a video ledger containing chronological attempts to complete their challenges. $NRG Packs would be minted any time a dathlete is about to challenge and push themselves to their very limit. A few reasons a dathlete would mint a new $NRG Pack would be: 

* **Learning a new skill. Exmaple: Learn a kick flip**
* **Competing in a tournament. Example: Competing in Jiu Jitsu tournament**
* **Breaking a world record**
* **Challenging an opponent to a duel⚔️**

Once the $NRG Pack is minted dathletes will be able charge these packs increasing their rarity and market value. To charge an $NRG Packs the dathlete lock up matter cards or lock up their respective fan tokens. 

For all you athletes out there, $NRG Cards will turn you into supercharged, goal oriented, APY farming powerhouse. Officially turning you into a dathlete!

### Trading
Since $NRG Cards are ERC 998 they allow for batch trading. In a single transaction, an owner can send the NRG Card and all of its underlying assets as a collective unit. NRG Cards are a collection of separate assets but carry a higher trading value when left combined. Batch Trading will allow you to transfer all the assets as a whole without being forced to separate each asset separately saving you in transaction fees!

## MATTER CARD
When a dathlete chooses to step up an challenge themselves they will be able to create a challenge for themselves also minting the $NRG Pack. All attempts at the challenge will be recorded and saved into a collectable known as Matter card. Matter cards contain the video footage of the dathlete attempting their challenge. Pass or fail the matter card is minted so they can be locked into and charge their respective $NRG Pack. 
Dathletes and fans can take the matter they collect and use it to power up their $NRG Pack.
