** Athlete ** - from the Greek origin ‚ÄúOne who competes with effort for a prize.‚Äù

** Dathlete ** - A individual who is proficient in sports and other forms of physical exercise & uses the power of web 3.0 and blockchain technology. Defi + Athlete = Dathlete. 

Now that you know the definition of an athlete, and a dathlete internalize it, and ask yourself, why do many athletes not have the opportunity to get that award? Why do so many athletes go unrewarded for their talent and dedication to their sport? Are the opportunities not the same for everyone? Are only some of them talented enough? Is it for some the effort is not proportional to their prize? Shenanigan encourages going further and never giving up. It gives athletes the chance to pursue their dreams and claim their prize! Shenanigan provides each athlete with the web3 instruments necessary to achieve this, it's your time! It's your career! It‚Äôs your life go get it!

Our athletes download the Shenanigan mobile app and register for an athlete account. Once registered as an athlete the user will interact with the simple to use interface, quickly fill in the relevant information to start with a challenge. Below is a quick example of the challenge questionnaire.

Example:

What sport do you play?

Athletics

What specific category of sport?

Medium distance running - 1500m

Add a title for your challenge

Run 1500m in less than 5 minutes

__Describe the challenge you are about to attempt__

I want to run 1500m in less than 5 minutes

After completing this information that will be the initial date of the athletes challenge, SHE mints the rare digital collectible card known as a ‚ÄúChallenge card‚Äù, along with its respective FAN Tokens and FAN CLUB. As the athlete attempts to complete these challenges they must livestream proof to the Shenanigan app where all the app users can vote on whether or not the athlete completed the challenge.

Shenanigan generates a community where fans can directly donate to the success of their favorite athletes while watching their progress!. By completing challenges athletes are able to claim donations that their fan club members have provided them.

Shenanigan also creates a market of challenges and predictions to gamify live broadcasts where challengers (athletes) can be incentivized in various ways:

Each time a prediction is made, a small percentage of the total value is placed in escrow. Once an athlete is successful with their challenge, the value is released from the deposit along with an additional reward from the community.

Comparable to baseball cards, NRG cards will track unique stats and attributes that belong to the athlete. These stats will help you win more fans because users will base their purchases on them. As you grow and complete more challenges, we'll update your NRG card to reflect those stats. Followers become more than just followers, they feel like part of the game, specifically the athlete's game, as the owners of an athlete card will want to see constant improvement.

Donations, live challenges and card exchanges make up the total reward the athlete can earn by simply challenging themselves in the sport they love the most!
