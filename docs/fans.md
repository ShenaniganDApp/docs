SHE generates a community where fans can directly donate to the success of their favorite athletes while watching their progress and collecting rare collectibles along the way! By donating to one's favorite athletes, fans will be rewarded with first call to limited digital collector cards! Fans can earn "Fan Tokens", by simply holding their favorite athletes trading card.

Fan Tokens are a native in app token which can be used to tip their favorite athletes or level up their favorite athlete's NRG cards increasing their desirabilty. SHE also offers a staking program which will allow fans to lock up their tokens to incure annual returns!

SHE also creates a market of challenges and predictions to gamify live broadcasts where spectators (fans) can be incentivized in various ways:
Once an athlete has created a challenge, fans will have the opportunity to wager their fan tokens on the success or failure of that specific challenge. If the fan is correct in their prediction they are awarded additional fan tokens!

Comparable to baseball cards, NRG cards will track unique stats and attributes that belong to the athlete. These stats will help you follow the progress and changes in you athlete. As the athletes complete more challenges, we'll update your NRG card to reflect those stats. Be more than just a follower, feel like you're a part of the game, specifically the athlete's coach, as an owners of an athlete card you will want to see constant improvement in your athlete!

Collect, trade and invest in your favorite athletes. Their success is your success!
