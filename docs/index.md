# Introduction

Shenanigan provides a competitive and motivating platform for athletes of all types utilizing fiscal incentives to drive personal improvement.

We are doing this because we believe that athletes should be payed for the hard work that they put in to train and hone their craft. Shenanigan is built by athletes for athletes to bring a different perspective to your everyday life.

Athletes spend spend countless hours of their lives to be able to take their game to the next level, often sacrificing relationships and time with friends and family. Few make it into the 1% of  professional play, but most reach a wall where they must choose between their personal responsibilities and their sport. We offer an opportunity to integrate the athletic grind into everday responsiblities. The platform we developed show cases athletes' skills and allows users to invest in their progression. Shenanigan uses NFTs to tokenize the athlete's progressive image and relies on a community of your pears and adversaries to generate liquidity for the althletes' token. The users (Particles) will give "energy" to the streamer (Ion) based on if they are for or against them.
