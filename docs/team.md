## TEAM

> SHE is a project built by a decentralized team of contributors from all over the world.

We are fully community-driven and eschew traditional corporate heirarchy. All top-level governance is publicly voted on via Snapshot, and prime-level governance is handled via our core team on DAOHaus.
