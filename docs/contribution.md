## Collaborate with us 👫️

Shenanigan takes pride in maintaining an open source and engaging community. Not only does open source garner a higher trust factor, we believe in the community as builders. Bloggers, developers, social media unicorns, however you make your mark, you are valued.

## Where to begin 🔎️

The first step is joining the [Discord](http://www.she.energy/join).
In our discord is where we communicate ideas, hold discussions, and make friends so [introduce](https://discord.gg/3N6YRD4) yourself first and then read on.

We love hearing comments and feedback so please, feel free to share. We promise to be nice and give respectful and honest opinions only. We have our community call every Monday at 9:00PM UTC. Stop by and say hello!

Second, take a minute to scan over the [pinkpaper](./pinkpaper) to learn about the project.

## Roles

Shenanigan is decentralized and open source, so we don't operate under a strict corporate hierarchy. Instead we are more like a collective of individual buidlers and entrepreneurs.

## Designers 🎨️

Designers are coveted in the crypto dapp sphere. You guys are the beautiful face of Shenanigan. Nothing makes a project cooler than great visual design. Whether you express yourself through art, photography, or memes.

Try your best to align with Shenanigan's futuristic, Futuristc, vintage colored olympic style.

We like to pretend that we are building an 80's olympic game event in the year 2080 😁.

_Tips_

- Check our [design doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E0ZrhPARruPgFXbz-cuiQSa7C4yzTrgSN3E-2w6L8cg/edit?usp=sharing).

- Ask @team on the discord for pointers.

- Make something and post it to the discord! You'll earn some Cred, which will determain the amount of SHE's governance token $PRTCLE you will be airdropped weakly!

## Developers 💻️

The anchor of this whole operation. Without any code, Shenanigan is just a hollow shell. First, head over to the [github](http://github.com/shenanigandapp) and fork the monorepo. Get the code you want to work on to compile by following the READMEs. Then, read our [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/ShenaniganDApp/shenanigan-monorepo/blob/master/Contributing.md) to understand how we structure our repos.

_note_ We are still in heavy alpha development and lots is changing around Shenanigan. So, please ask around in the discord if you're interested. We can accommodate you personally for the time being if any issues arise.
