### Collaborate with us 👫️

Shenanigan takes pride in maintaining an open source and engaging community. 
Not only does open source garner a higher trust factor, we believe in the community as builders. Bloggers, developers, social media unicorns, however you make your mark, you are valued.

### Where to begin 🔎️

The first step is joining the [Discord](http://www.she.energy/join). 

In our discord is we communicate ideas, hold discussions, and make friends so [introduce](https://discord.gg/3N6YRD4) yourself first and then read on.

We love hearing comments and feedback so please, feel free to share. We promise to be nice and give respectful and honest opinions only.

Second, take a minute to scan over the [whitepaper](https://she.energy/wiki/whitepaper/) to learn about the project.


### Roles
Shenanigan is decentralized and open source, so we don't operate under a strict corporate hierarchy. Instead we are more like a collective of individual buidlers and entrepreneurs.

### Designers 🎨️

Designers are coveted in the crypto dapp sphere. You guys are the beautiful face of Shenanigan. Nothing makes a project cooler than great visual design. Whether you express yourself through art, photography, or memes.

Try your best to align with Shenanigan's futuristic, techno-punk arcade style.

We like to pretend that we are building an 80's arcade in the year 2080 😁.
