## Collaborate with us 👫️

Shenanigan takes pride in maintaining an open source and engaging community. Not only does open source garner a higher trust factor, we believe in the community as builders. Bloggers, developers, social media unicorns, however you make your mark, you are valued.

## Where to begin 🔎️

The first step is joining the [Discord](http://www.she.energy/join).
In our discord is where we communicate ideas, announce propsals, future updates, hold discussions, and make life long friendships so waste no time and come [introduce](https://discord.gg/3N6YRD4) yourself first and then read on.

We love hearing comments and feedback so please, feel free to share. We promise to be nice and give respectful and honest opinions only. We have our community call every Monday at 9:00PM UTC. Stop by say hello and give us your feedback and ideas!

Second, if you truly wish to help SHE take a minute to scan over the [pinkpaper](./pinkpaper) this will help you learn about the project and give you an idea on the role you could play in SHE's universe.

## Roles

Shenanigan is decentralized and open source, so we don't operate under a strict corporate hierarchy. Instead we are more like a collective of individual buidlers and entrepreneurs.

### Developers 💻️

The anchor of this whole operation. Without any code, Shenanigan is just a hollow shell. First, head over to the [github](http://github.com/shenanigandapp) and fork the monorepo. Get the code you want to work on to compile by following the READMEs. Then, read our [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/ShenaniganDApp/shenanigan-monorepo/blob/master/Contributing.md) to understand how we structure our repos. After having an understanding of the project, reviewing the issues and speaking with the team dive right in and start tackleing some problems and submit your PR'S!

### Designers 🎨️

Designers are coveted in the crypto dapp sphere. You guys are the beautiful face of Shenanigan. Nothing makes a project cooler than great visual design. Whether you express yourself through art, photography, or memes.

Try your best to align with Shenanigan's futuristic, Futuristc, vintage colored olympic style.
We like to pretend that we are building an 80's olympic game event in the year 2080 😁.

**_Tips_**

* Check our [design doc](./na).

* Ask @team on the discord for pointers.

* Make something and post it to the discord! You'll earn some Cred, which will determain the amount of SHE's governance token $PRTCLE you will be airdropped weakly!
