## Welcome to SHE: Streamers Empowered by Decentralized Predictions

SHE (Shenanigan) is a community-driven platform that brings the excitement of streamer communities into the realm of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (a.k.a DAOs). Our mission is to create a seamless and enjoyable experience between streamers and their fans, with the ultimate goal of forming an interconnected community that thrives on the power of livestreaming.

By integrating streamer communities into the SHE decentralized governance model, we aim to create an engaging and rewarding environment that encourages users to actively participate and support their favorite streamers.

## Key Features of SHE

### Weekly Governance Distribution of PRTCLE

SHE distributes its native token, $PRTCLE, on a weekly basis to active community members who contribute to the platform's growth and success. $PRTCLE governs the SHE DAO and its distributions, ensuring a decentralized and community-driven decision-making process.

### Community-Owned Livestream

SHE supports existing streamers by incorporating existing platforms, like Twitch, and its communities into the SHE DAO model, providing a soverign experience for both streamers and viewers while enriching the sense of camaraderie and fun.

### PRTCLE Predictions

The core feature of SHE, PRTCLE Predictions, utilizes a Chrome extension to integrate web3 tokens into existing Twitch predictions. This enables viewers to stake $PRTCLE or other chosen tokens, fostering a captivating and rewarding environment that enhances the excitement of watching streamers grow and improve.

By offering innovative features and a user-friendly experience, SHE aims to become the go-to platform for streamers and their communities seeking a decentralized governance model that celebrates the joy of shared success and fosters a vibrant, interconnected ecosystem.
