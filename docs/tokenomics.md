## SHE Brings Us $PRTCLE
$PRTCLE at its core, operates primarily as Shenanigan's governance token. However, its functionality extends far beyond just that. $PRTCLE can be used to support athletes, generate NFT rarity, accrue Defi Rewards, and provide exposure to the entire network of athletes that use Shenanigan. SHE believes in rewarding those who work hard. $PRTCLE is 100% community driven and has never relied on VC funding or promotions such as ICO's or airdrops.
 
## MINTING PROCESS
SHE has chosen to mint 20,000 $PRTCLE per week and distributes them proportionally to the entire community. Instead of relying on an ICO or arbitrary airdrop list, SHE utilizes [SourceCred](https://sourcecred.io/) to track and monitor community membersâ€™ contribution as a method of ensuring that those who earn $PRTCLE are the ones who care the most about the project.

As the platform grows, that same 20,000 will remain fixed while being distributed among an ever-increasing userbase. This method of token creation was used as a way to increase the scarcity of the Token. When demand for $PRTCLE exceeds its current weekly minting amount a proposal can always be submitted to either increase the weekly supply or decrease it further increasing the scarcity! 

  ## WEEKLY DISTRUBUTION 
SourceCred is tool for communities to measure and reward value creation. SHE uses it to track data gathered from Discord, Github PR's and SHE's mobile app, ased on your creations, contributions and community involvement. Weather you have skills as a developer, artist, marketer or have great people skills there's enough $PRTCLE

Dathletes, developers, artists, community leaders, social media unicorns and SHE herself are all rewarded in $PRTCLE each week for their dedication to changing how dathletes montize themselves and fans interact with their favorite dathletes.
